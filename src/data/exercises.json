    "description": "In this exercise, you will train your eyes, hand, and mind to work together by practicing pure observation. Without looking at your paper at all, place your pencil where you want to begin. Then, very slowly move your eyes along the edges (contours) of the subject while simultaneously moving your hand across the paper, trying to match the speed of your eye with the movement of your pencil. Try not lift your pencil from the paper until you have completed the drawing. It is important that you do not worry about how the drawing looks, the purpose is not to create a beautiful image but to strengthen the connection between your eye and hand and to truly experience the form you are observing.",

    "description": "In this exercise, you'll practice drawing the gesture of a subject. The goal is to quickly capture the essence and movement rather than the details. You'll have one minute to draw each image. Focus on the overall shape and action of the subject—not how it looks, but what it is doing. Draw rapidly and continuously in a flowing, unbroken line—top to bottom, around and around—without lifting your pencil from the paper. Don't worry about making a perfect drawing. This is about improving your observation and expressive drawing skills. Avoid using an eraser; instead, draw over any mistakes. Since you'll be doing a lot of quick sketches, use both sides of the paper and stick to inexpensive materials.",

    "description": "In this exercise, you'll explore cross contours—imaginary lines that wrap around the form of the body, helping to reveal its three-dimensional structure. Start by placing your pencil on a point along the outer contour and move it across the figure at a right angle to that edge, letting your eyes and hand follow the surface of the form. These curved lines dip into hollows and rise over muscles, much like barrel hoops around a rounded object or adhesive tape pressed along the skin. Unlike inside contours, which define distinct features like the nose, cross contours can begin or end anywhere and shift depending on the figure's position. Focus on drawing smooth, horizontal lines that describe volume and depth, occasionally including vertical lines down the torso or limbs for anatomical clarity. Though the marks may look abstract or scattered, they strengthen your sense of form and create a more physical, tactile connection with the subject.",
